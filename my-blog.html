        <p>Author : <a class="author-name" href="www.google.com">Robin Mia</a> </p>
        <p class="details">During the early 9th century the greater Chittagong area, including Cox's Bazar, was under
            the rule of Arakan
            kings until its conquest by the Mughals in 1666.[6] When the Mughal Prince Shah Shuja was passing through
            the
            hilly terrain of the present-day Cox's Bazar on his way to Arakan, he was attracted to its scenic and
            captivating beauty. He commanded his forces to camp there. His retinue of one thousand palanquins stopped
            there
            for some time. A place named Dulahazara, meaning "one thousand palanquins," still exists in the area. After
            the
            Mughals, the place came under the control of the Tipras and the Arakanese, followed by the Portuguese and
            then
            the British.</p>
